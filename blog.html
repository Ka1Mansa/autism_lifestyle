            <h2 class="blog-title">START OF MY JOURNEY: Why I chose Autism</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">I get asked a lot, why autism? The thing is, I never knew what autism is until I joined the Special needs field. It was after my high-school during that confused state of what next? That one of my uncles asked me to do a foreign language as I decide the career path I want to follow. I settled with Chinese and as I was undertaking the course, I interacted with some of the friends I had made, the special needs topic came along and I developed an interest in the area. I googled some of the school I could join and I landed at Kenya Institute of Special Education (KISE). 
                Allow me to take you back; Before joining KISE, I was declined the opportunity to join as I did not have an educational background. I had to take a step back and take a certificate course in Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE). It was a fun experience as I got to learn how to care for children and how to train and create a strong foundation for them.
                Back to where we had left off, I was finally able to join KISE for a 2year course. During the first year, I was able to interact with all areas of disability, how to identify them and how to manage them. It is still on my first year that I was able to learn about autism for the first time. Since I had to choose an area of specialization, it was quiet hard as all the areas were interesting and my heard yearned to interact with all of them as my goal was to train all learners with special needs. At this time, autism was still new and only a few people in the country had studied it. I became curious about it and wanted to find out why it’s a mystery to many and that is how I ended up settling with it as my area of specialization in my second year.
                At the beginning, curiosity drove me towards autism. As I did more research on it, learnt about it and interacted with learners living with autism, I was able to grow a passion for it and it grew on me so strong that it’s all want to talk about. 
                There are a lot of gaps when it comes to causes and the cure of autism. I am starting this blogging journey in order to try and cover that gap and to also walk with parents and care givers through this interesting yet confusing journey of living with autism and caring for persons with autism. 
                As we embark on this journey, I will share my experiences, challenges and how I was able to overcome them.

            <h2 class="blog-title">MY LEARNING EXPERIENCE AS A STUDENT</h2>
            <p class="blog-content">Being a student is never easy for anyone and I was not spared. This was a new field and there were lots of new vocabularies and experiences that I had to grasp and understand in a period of one year. I decide to go out of my way and volunteer to various organizations and also at our model school at KISE in order to understand more about what autism is outside the books. 
                I am very grateful that I started my career at the diploma level and this is why; KISE is a very strict learning institution and they ensure their students are thoroughly trained. We took part in lots of group discussions, made lots of materials and in the process I was able to acquire the skill of improvisation. 
                We also got a chance to train physical activities (P.E) to learners with autism. I can still remember vividly when we were in the field for our P.E session and we were training the learners the throwing and catching skill. My assigned learner threw the ball far and immediately ran after it. At the back of my mind, I was so happy and boosted to my peers that my learner was able to run after the ball. 
                I waited for him to come back and little did I know that he was not planning on coming back to the playground. I ran after him and it took me almost twenty minutes to find him. These were the longest minutes of my life. I finally found him hiding under the slides, busy singing while tossing the ball up in the air. I had to take some minutes to breath, thank God that he was okay and gently took him back to the play field. 
                My learner did not find this as a big deal, rather, he saw an opportunity for him to be in a safe space where there are no much sensory input and he grabbed it. I came to realize that he hated noise and large crowds. This was my first lesson that I had to learn the hard way. It is important to understand your child/learner before starting to train them.
